These are some of my finds, with a Sony IMX 298 sensor. Those cameras are chep on AliExpress, I paid around 20 USD for one. Keep in mind that the values might not work on your camera. Also, this is work in progress, some might be wrong, etc. Changing some settings require restarting the stream. if you find new things, please let me know (open an issue), or e-mail me at radu.prv at gmail.
resolutions offset:
0xd1a-d = 4656x3496

0x1455-6 something with the clock/frame rate
0x1459-a clock/framerate.  0x24 really slow, bright image. 0x9E pretty dim, 0x11 so and so, 0x09 brightish, 0xDC very dim, 1b very bright
0x145a some clock 

0xcf6  0xD1 makes the image normal

0x802 (4 bytes) = lightmeter. It's influenced by analogue gain and exposure, but not by ISP settings such as gamma or digital gain.
0x835 another 'lightmeter', 16b, based on gain and exposure, but not on light

0x128 changes brightness.

0x16c-d: exposure (from uvc)

0xa30 any bit set and digital gain is turned to 0
0xa31 bits 1-6 digital gain!
0xa32 makes the image SLIGHTLY brighter
0xa37-0xa39 exposure
Powerline 60 hz
  0x0A3F: 0x03 -> 0x04
  0x0A43: 0x01 -> 0x02
  0xa44 -> dynamic frame rate?
Powerline 50 hz
  0x0A3F: 0x04 -> 0x03
  0x0A43: 0x02 -> 0x01

 0x0A43: (0 disable powerline frequency)
0x0A4E - backlight compensation (0xE2 -> 0x00)
 

This is sometimes busy with the same value
[0x0A3B] = 0x1C [RO/BUSY] (Got: 0x17)


0x0214 makes the image very bright and a bit washed out or very red after stream restart
0x0215 makes the image brighter

0x021e makes the image brighter, less detail
0x021f makes the image darker usuually, possibly some bits are related to vigneting

0x228 values like 0xE3, 0xBA, 0x46 make the image brighter, washed out 0x7C brings it back to normal
0x229  gain from UVC, capped at 64 via uvc but can go up to 0xff. Needs a stream restart
0x234 possibly rgb channel gains ?
0x235 possibly rgb channel gains ?
0x240 possibly rgb channel gains ?
0x241 uvc saturation
0x24b sharpening (some bits of it)
0x254 fucks up the image, some sort of negative
0x255 some sort of gain or contrast
0x25e WB from UVC
0x269 awb trigger
0x2DD disables the sharpening slider, sometimes changes the sharpening to higher
0x2DE disables gain
